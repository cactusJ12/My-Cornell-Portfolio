# Machine Learning Project: Defining and Solving a ML Problem

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to define and solve a machine learning problem using real-world census data. The workflow includes problem framing, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

The notebook, `DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb`, walks through the entire ML pipeline in a structured and interpretable manner.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is `censusData.csv`, which contains demographic and economic information from a census. The data is used to predict a target variable, such as income level or employment status (depending on the framing in the notebook).

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Define an ML problem using the census dataset
- Preprocess and clean the data
- Engineer features relevant to the predictive task
- Train and evaluate classification/regression models
- Interpret results and assess model performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if applicable)
